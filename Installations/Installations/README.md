# GSQL - The Little Black Book Of Code
This is a collection of Tips &amp; Trick and How-Too's to write and overcome difficult challenges with in TigerGrap and the GSQL language.

This repository is will always be work in progress.  I will try to sort the folder structure thinking ahead but I will never be smarter today than I will be tomorrow.  So please bear with me.

At the time of this writing I am thinking of structuring of following a patern of Installion(Installations, Configurations, Running, Managing & Monitor), ETL (Extractint, Transforming, Loadind and Automation), and Reporting(configuration, Formatting, Automating).  It feels like a good pattern for now.  But it might change in the future.

If you have questions, comments or would like to contribute please let me know
